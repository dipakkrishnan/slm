This project implements a **small auto-regressive transformer** in **Python**. The transformer is designed for language modeling tasks, and it is trained on the **Wikitext-2** dataset. The project leverages the power of **Rust** for 1. efficient model inference, 2. a simple rest api centered around completions.
