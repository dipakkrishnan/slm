# ðŸ¦€ SLM

This project implements a **small auto-regressive transformer** in **Rust**. The transformer is designed for language modeling tasks, and it is trained on the **Wikitext-2** dataset. The project leverages the power of Rust for efficient model training and execution, while Python is used for preprocessing the dataset. 

## âœ¨ Features
- Implementation of an auto-regressive transformer model in Rust.
- Efficient training loop utilizing `tch-rs` for PyTorch-like tensor operations.
